# grateful 0.1.9

* Fixed potential bug when matching package names with citation keys. Now using more strict regex.

# grateful 0.1.7

* New option output = "table" to produce a table with package names, version, and citation, 
to be used within an Rmarkdown document.

# grateful 0.1.5

* Now including package versions, besides package name.

* For packages specifying more than one reference in their CITATION file, use all of them.

* Rather than a list of package names, grateful now returns a text paragraph citing R and all the used packages, ready to be pasted in a manuscript or report.

* Now including base R citation in all cases. Can optionally add RStudio too.

* grateful can now be used within Rmarkdown. Including a chunk with `cite_packages(output = "paragraph")` will introduce a paragraph with in-text citations of R and the used packages, and their citations will be formatted when rendering the Rmarkdown document.

* It is also possible to cite particular packages using their BibTeX keys generated by grateful. Or include them in the reference list without citing them in-text, using the new `nocite_references()` function.

* New argument `cite.tidyverse` to collapse citations of all used tidyverse packages into a single citation to 'tidyverse'.

* New argument `dependencies` to include package dependencies in the citation list.

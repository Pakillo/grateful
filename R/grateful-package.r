#' Grateful: Citing R and R Packages
#'
#' Find R packages used in a project, create a BibTeX file of citations, and
#' cite them in either a new or existing document. See the primary function
#' \code{\link{cite_packages}} for full details and usage instructions, and
#' \code{\link{nocite_references}} for including package citations in the
#' bibliography of an RMarkdown document.
#'
#' The goal of `grateful` is to make it very easy to cite the R packages used in any report or publication. By calling a single function, it will scan the project for R packages used, and generate a document with citations in the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown).
#'
#' Importantly, these references can be formatted for a specific journal so that we can just paste them directly into the bibliography list of our manuscript or report.
#'
#' If you prefer to get just a BibTeX file with all package citations, it can also be done (see examples in https://github.com/Pakillo/grateful).

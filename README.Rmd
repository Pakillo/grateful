[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/connorp/grateful.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/connorp/grateful)

The goal of `grateful` is to make it very easy to cite the R packages used in any report or publication. By calling a single function, it will scan the project for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing all citations for those packages. `grateful` can then either generate a new document with citations in the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown), or list citation keys to incorporate into an existing RMarkdown document. These references can be formatted for a specific journal so that we can just paste them directly into the bibliography list of our manuscript or report.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("connorp/grateful")
```

## Basic Usage

`grateful` can be used in one of two ways: to generate a new document listing each package and its citation, as well as a references list, or to build citation keys to incorporate into an existing RMarkdown document. 

Imagine a project where we are using the following packages: readr, dplyr, vegan, lme4, and ggplot2. We want to collect all the citations listed for these packages, as well as a citation for base R (and for RStudio, if applicable). 

### Generate a New References Document

Calling `cite_packages(generate.document = TRUE)` will scan the project, find these packages, and generate a document with formatted citations.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(grateful)
cite_packages(generate.document = TRUE)
```

This document can also be a Word document, PDF file, markdown file, or left as the source Rmarkdown file using `out.format`. We can specify the citation style for a particular journal using `style`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
cite_packages(style = "ecology", out.format = "docx")
```

You can also save the output of `cite_packages` to a specified directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Save the output in RMarkdown format only and to a docs subfolder.
cite_packages(out.format = "rmd", out.dir = file.path(getwd(), "docs"))
```

### Add Citations to an Existing Document

If you are building a document in RMarkdown and want to cite R packages, `grateful` can generate a BibTeX file and return the citation keys. 

First, include a reference to the BibTeX file in your YAML header. 

```
bibliography: pkg-refs.bib
```

RMarkdown lets you reference multiple BibTeX files, if needed.

```
bibliography: 
- document_citations.bib
- pkg-refs.bib
```

Then call `cite_packages(generate.document = FALSE)` to return a vector of citation keys.

```{r eval = FALSE}
citationkeys <- cite_packages(generate.document = FALSE, all.pkgs = FALSE)
```

Note that `all.pkgs = TRUE` does not work when being knitted within an RMarkdown document, due to a limitation of `checkpoint::scanForPackages()`. 

These citation keys can then be referenced within the document, or to just include citations in the References section, use `nocite_references()` to place them in a [metadata block](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#unused_references_(nocite)) for inclusion in the References section without an in-text citation. `nocite_references()` can be called either inline or in a code chunk (with `echo = FALSE`) in the body of your document, and returns the text "as-is", so a chunk with `results = 'asis'` is not required. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
nocite_references(citationkeys)
```

## Workflow

`cite_packages` is a wrapper function which internally performs the following steps:

1. Scan the project for packages

  ```{r eval = FALSE}
  pkgs <- scan_packages()
  ```

2. Get citations for each package

  ```{r eval = FALSE}
  cites <- get_citations(pkgs)
  ```

3. If an output file is requested (`generate.document = TRUE`), generate and render the file.

  ```{r eval = FALSE}
  rmd <- create_rmd(cites)
  render_citations(rmd, output = "html")
  ```
  
  Otherwise, use the citation keys in text, or include them in the References file.
  
  ```{r eval = FALSE}
  nocite_references(citationkeys)
  ```

## Limitations

`all.pkgs = TRUE` fails if run within `knitr` when compiling an RMarkdown document. `checkpoint::scanForPackages` is unable to search for packages  within the temporary directory used by `knitr::knit`.

`include.RStudio = TRUE` fails if run from an R session that is not in an RStudio interactive session, including being run by `knitr`, even when initiated by knitting in RStudio. The function `RStudio.Version()` is only defined in RStudio interactive sessions.

Citation keys are not guaranteed to be preserved when regenerated, particularly when packages are updated. This instability is not an issue when citations are used programmatically, as in the example below. But if references are put into the text manually, they may need to be updated periodically.

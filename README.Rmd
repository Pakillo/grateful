# grateful: Facilitate citation of R packages

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/Pakillo/grateful/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Pakillo/grateful/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **grateful** is to make it very easy to cite R and the R packages used in any analyses, so that package authors receive their deserved credit. By calling a single function, **grateful** will scan the project for R packages used and generate a BibTeX file containing all citations for those packages. 

**grateful** can then generate a new document with citations in the desired output format (Word, PDF, HTML, Markdown). These references can be formatted for a specific journal, so that we can just paste them directly into our manuscript or report. 

Alternatively, we can use **grateful** directly within an Rmarkdown document. In this case, a paragraph containing in-text citations of all used R packages will (optionally) be inserted into the Rmarkdown document, and these packages will be included in the reference list when rendering. 

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Pakillo/grateful")
```

## Usage

**grateful** can be used in one of two ways: (i) to generate a new document listing each package and their citations, or (ii) to build citation keys to incorporate into an existing RMarkdown document. 

Imagine a project where we are using the packages: *lme4* and *mgcv*. We want to collect all the citations listed for these packages, as well as a citation for base R (and for RStudio, if applicable). 

### Generate a document with formatted citations

Calling `cite_packages(output = "file")`, or simply `cite_packages()`, will scan the project, find these packages, and generate a document with formatted citations.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(grateful)
cite_packages(output = "file")
```

This document can also be a Word document, PDF file, markdown file, or left as the source Rmarkdown file using `out.format`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
cite_packages(out.format = "docx")
```

We can specify the citation style for a particular journal using `citation.style`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
cite_packages(citation.style = "peerj")
```


In all cases a BibTeX (.bib) file with all package citations will be saved to disk. 


### Using grateful within Rmarkdown

If you are building a document in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and want to cite R packages, **grateful** can automatically generate a BibTeX file and ensure these packages are cited in the appropriate format. 

First, include a reference to the BibTeX file in your YAML header. 

```
bibliography: grateful-refs.bib
```

(Note: RMarkdown lets you reference multiple BibTeX files, if needed)

```
bibliography: 
- document_citations.bib
- grateful-refs.bib
```

Then call `cite_packages(output = "paragraph")` within a code chunk (specifying chunk option: `results = "asis"`) to automatically include a paragraph mentioning all the used packages, and include their references in the bibliography list. 

````
```{r results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}`r ''`
cite_packages(output = "paragraph")
```
````

`We used R version 4.1.2 [@base] and the following R packages: lme4 v. 1.1.27.1 [@lme4], mgcv v. 1.8.38 [@mgcv2003; @mgcv2004; @mgcv2011; @mgcv2016; @mgcv2017].`

If you want the references to appear in a particular format, you can specify the citation style in the YAML header:

```
bibliography: grateful-refs.bib
csl: peerj.csl
```

Alternatively, you can cite particular packages using the citation keys generated by **grateful**, as with any other BibTeX reference, or just include citations in the References section, using the function `nocite_references()`. See the package help and the [RMarkdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html) for more details.


#### Using grateful with the tidyverse

If you use one or several packages from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), you can choose to cite the 'tidyverse' rather than the individual packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cite_packages(cite.tidyverse = TRUE)
```

#### Including package dependencies

Most packages also depend on other packages. To include those package dependencies in your citations, rather than just the packages you called directly, use `dependencies = TRUE`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cite_packages(dependencies = TRUE)
```


## Limitations

Citation keys are not guaranteed to be preserved when regenerated, particularly when packages are updated. This instability is not an issue when citations are used programmatically, as in the example above. But if references are put into the text manually, they may need to be updated periodically.
